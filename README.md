**A Stackelberg Approach to Transport Infrastructure Planning: Integrating User Decision-Making
This repository contains the implementation instances of the paper "A Stackelberg Approach to Transport Infrastructure Planning: Integrating User Decision-Making" by Oscar-Mauricio Cepeda-Valero, José-Fidel Torres-Delgado, and Andres D. González.

The proposed model focuses on integrating user behavior with transport infrastructure planning, combining both operator and user objectives within a Stackelberg framework. The evaluation of the model involves multiobjective analysis, different network topologies, and origin-destination (OD) networks.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into three main folders, each containing essential data and components related to the research:

Folder 1: Multiobjective
This folder contains the instances used to evaluate the multiobjective model. These instances define the configurations of various transport system designs and are intended to optimize multiple objectives such as user cost, operator cost, and system coverage.

Folder 2: Networks
This folder holds the structure of the different transport networks used in the study. It provides the details of various network topologies and settings that help assess the performance and adaptability of the proposed model.

Folder 3: ODflow
Here, you will find the different origin-destination networks used in the instances. These networks represent various demand patterns and routes, which are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of the transport system under different user behaviors and system conditions.
